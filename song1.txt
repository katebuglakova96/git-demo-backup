All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
Ahhh, that's how you sang it
Loving you forever, can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
Ahhh, that's how we played it

And there's no remedy for memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me
That everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
